## Even Fibonacci numbers ##

### Problem Statement ###
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Approach ###
We will create two variables f1=0 and f2=1 to store the first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence first. We will then create a variable sum=0 to store the sum of the even-valued terms. We will then create a while loop that will run until the value of f2 is less than 4 million. In the while loop, we will check if f2 is even. If it is, we will add it to the sum variable. We will then update the values of f1 to f2 and f2 to f1+f2. We will then print the value of the sum variable.
